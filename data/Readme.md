# DATASET

The dataset for the IGLU challenge was available at https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2022-iglu-challenge-nlp-task/dataset_files

After the competition was over on 31st Oct 2022, it was removed. 

But we do have classifier dataset with us. If you are a teaching staff for CS7650 Fall 2022, please reach out to fhasan8@gatech.edu for accessing the CSV containing dataset for the classification problem.
